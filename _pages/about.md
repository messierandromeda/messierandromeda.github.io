I am a student currently studying Computer Science in the 4th semester at Freie Universit√§t Berlin. My plan is to do an internship at summer 2024 related to data science or machine learning and getting to work on real-life projects. What especially interests me is the "behind the scenes" of machine learning, so I also read about the newest publications in the field. Not only do the newest research results interest me, but also the theoretical ideas on how they exactly work. I also plan to create some machine learning projects using what I've learned, combining the theoretical and practical aspects. 

The topics in machine learning that I have read and found the most interesting are these, but not limited to: generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, neural style transfer, language models. 

Currently, I am planning to do some projects related to machine learning in summer. Ideally, the projects will be done by this September/October, latest next February/March they should be completed. I will put the detailed descriptions on the Projects tab. 

## These are the modules that I have completed:

<!-- todo: should I include so much? or just list the most relevant ones? -->

* Object-Oriented Programming
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* Databases
* Discrete Mathematics
* Linear Algebra
* Analysis
* Theory of Computation
* Concurrent and distributed programming
* Computer Architecture and Operating Systems
* Functional Programming

## List of programming/markup languages, packages and tools I'm familiar with:
* Python (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) <!--, keras, tensorflow): creating graphs and did some data cleaning/preprocessing. -->
* SQL
* Java
* C
* Git, GitHub, GitLab
* LaTeX
* HTML
